# The Odin Media Project

The main purpose of the project is to draw on my understanding of working with media by building a YouTube's video player page.

The goal of the project is not to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up.

This means two things,

-  Embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays.
-  Showing little thumbnail images along the right side.

## Skills to be demonstrated

-  Embedding a video in an web page
-  Position elements using flex box
